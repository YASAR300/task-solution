# Git and Version Control Guide

## Part 1: Introduction to Version Control and Git

### Task 1: Install and Configure Git
- Configure Git with your username and email:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
  ```

### 2.View your Git configuration
- Use git config --list to verify your configuration.
   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```


### Task 2: Initialize a Repository
- git init sets up a Git repository in the current folder. The .git folder contains all necessary
 information for version control.
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

### Task 3: Create a File and Make Multiple Commits

 - This demonstrates the core Git workflow: making changes, staging, and committing.
 - echo for file create
  - push code to see changes
 - 
   ```bash
   echo "My First Project" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Added README.md"
   echo "Added a description" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Updated README with a description"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-user-name/name.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Task 4: Check Status and Log
 - git status shows the current state of the working directory.

   ```bash
     git status
     ```
 - git log provides a history of commits. The --oneline flag condenses it for readability.

   ```bash
    git log --oneline --graph --decorate
    ```
### Task 5: Create and Clone a Repository
  - for clone

    ```bash
      git clone http://user-name/name-repo.git
    ```

### Task 6: Understanding the Git Workflow
 
   - Explains the typical cycle of modifying, staging, and committing changes.
       
        ```bash

            echo "Workflow example" > workflow.md
            git add workflow.md
            git commit -m "Added workflow example"
        ```


# Part 2: Working with Repositories

### Task 7: Branching and Merging

 - git branch creates new branches to isolate features or changes.
  ```bash
    git branch feature-login
    git checkout feature-login
   ``` 
  - git merge integrates changes from one branch into another.

   ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge feature-login
   ```
## Task 8: Handling Merge Conflicts
 - Provides hands-on experience with resolving conflicts, a common scenario in team collaboration.
```bash
    git branch branch-A
    git branch branch-B
    git checkout main
    git merge branch-A
    git merge branch-B  # Conflict occurs here
    # Resolve conflict in the file manually
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between branch-A and branch-B"
   ```
### Task 9: Renaming and Deleting Branches

  - git branch -m renames branches, while git branch -d deletes branches no longer needed.

     ```bash
       git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
       git branch -d feature-login
     ```

# Part 3: Advanced Git Operations
## Task 10: Using Git Stash

 - echo for cerate a file but dont use commit

  ```bash
    echo "Temporary work" >> temp.md
  ```
  - Stashing allows you to save changes temporarily without committing them.
    ```bash
      git stash
    ```
 - git stash apply re-applies stashed changes, and git stash drop removes them.
   ```bash
     git stash apply
     git stash drop
   ```
## Task 11: Rewriting History with Interactive Rebase
  - Squashing commits consolidates them for a cleaner history. Use pick for the first commit and squash for subsequent ones in the rebase interface.

       ```bash
          git rebase -i HEAD~3
       ```

## Task 12: Cherry-Picking Commits
  - Lets you apply specific commits from one branch to another without merging the whole branch.
   
     ```bash
       git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
     ```

## Task 13: Tagging Commits
  - Tags mark important points in your history, like release versions.
     ```bash
       git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
       git push origin v1.0
     ```

## Task 14: Working with Remote Repositories
 - git remote add connects your local repo to a remote one, enabling collaboration.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   git push origin main
   ```
# Part 4: Additional Practice

## Task 15: Forking and Contributing

  - Forking allows you to work on someone else's repository. Creating a pull request submits your changes back to the original project.

  - Fork a repository on GitHub, clone it, create a new branch, make changes, and push:
   
     ```bash
        git checkout -b fix-typo
        echo "Typo fixed" >> README.md
        git add README.md
        git commit -m "Fixed a typo"
        git push origin fix-typo
     ```

## Task 16: Simulate Team Collaboration

  - Practices resolving real-world issues like merge conflicts during collaborative work.
    
## Task 17: Git Ignore
   -  .gitignore ensures specific files or directories, such as node_modules/, are not tracked by Git.
  
       ```bash
          echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
          git add .
       ```
